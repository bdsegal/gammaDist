Description: This package implements distribution functions for gamma random variables, including the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the difference in the means of gamma random variables, a saddlepoint approximation to the CDF, and a Newton-Raphson routine for computing the maximum likelihood estimates for iid gamma random variables. The CDF for the difference in means is derived by Klar (2015).
